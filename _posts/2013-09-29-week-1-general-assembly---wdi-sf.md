I just completed my first week of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program and I feel like I've been sitting with my classmates for months! Where to start?

#### About General Assembly WDI

General Assembly's Web Development Immersive ("WDI") program is a 3-month coding program. One learns Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, JSON, and some more stuff that involves to many acronyms and numbers that I don't remember.

#### Pre-Work

Before starting the program I had to complete some pre-work on Ruby, Git, HTML, and CSS. The HTML and CSS were great to refresh because I haven't touched those things is years! Git was completely foreign to me, and Ruby was similar to JavaScript in terms of its functions/methods and classes.

#### Week 1

My first week was very interesting. After being out of college for a year and not doing anything remotely similar to coding/programming in years it was a very difficult transition for me to plummet into the program.

#### Terminal and GitHub
On the first day we went over some basic terminal and git commands. Learning how to navigate through the terminal was a bit scary for me. The laptop that I use isn't mine so I was thoroughly irked out with using the terminal to create and delete things. GitHub was also very alien to me. I have never used GitHub for anything in my entire life! The concept of having to work locally, then adding/commiting/pushing my local files to a repository ("reopo"), and the  requesting for a pull for my instructors to merge my files in my repo to theirs' was interesting to grasp at first. However, after using the terminal and GitHub for a good solid 3.75 days... I became completely comfortable with the terminal and I can sort of say that I GET GIT (I think)! On Friday (9/27) I was able to help my classmates with their Git problems! Am I a Git pro now? Just kidding.

An important command that really helped me out was: 

      find . -name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 git rm --ignore-unmatch

One of the silliest problems that I have with Git is the over creation of **.ds** files in my repo. Using the above removes all **.ds** files so I can properly add, commit, and push my new files.

#### Ruby
As I mentioned previously, I've never seen, touched, or tasted Ruby... ever. The only exposure that I had with the language was with the pre-work. When we reviewed some basics on the first day I was like: Yeah, my life is nice and randy dandy. However, when we began to work on methods/functions and it's scoping properties, I felt so silly. I felt like I was a second year Spanish student amongst people who've lived in Spain for 6 months and is now fluent. I also realized that I don't think like a coder yet. When I approach a project, I think backwards. I'm not quite sure if that's good, but I tend to get really stuck on a solution because I tend to over think about how the outcome should be.

#### Week 1 Weekend
On Saturday I headed over to class for a review session. I ended up sitting with a few of my classmates in a separate lab space to work on my own project. The hardest part about learning something on my own is focusing at one thing at a time. I'm the type of person who is like: Ok, I just learned something. Give me some time for me to play with it. Wait, something new? Hold on. I want to learn the new thing now!... I think I just get way to excited.
