I've been living in San Francisco for about 21 days so far and I like it. The neighborhoods are rich with culture and very vibrant. What I find even more enthralling is the overall jovial demeanor of the people. Perhaps it's because I've been encountering individuals outside of the Financial District... Maybe it's the weather.

My story of coming to San Francisco, I think, is pretty normal. Long story short, I relocated from Boston to San Francisco after reaching a quarter-life crisis.Â At one point, I considered joining the military. For a good three years of my short life I really wanted to fly and piloting an F-14 had once been a dream of mine. I planned on entering the Air Force after high school, but then I was peer-pressured into applying to college... Everybody was doing it and I guess I had to as well. After college I contemplated about joining the Navy. Oh boy, to be on a carrier with a deck pitching as high as 30 feet every minute - fantastic (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gGMI8d3vLs)!

Operation "Join the Navy" began in March 2013. I covered spatial apperception, basic mechanical/thermal/electrical physics, GRE/GMAT Mathematics, and basic reading comprehension. In conjunction with the mental acrobatics, I went through a regimented physical schedule. It was a blast (not really). The culmination of this Naval preparation ended with a big nothing. I chickened out because I didn't want to be a quitter (ironic?). It was either join the Navy forever or never for me. I wasn't ready to make that commitment (the officer cutoff age is ~27 so I have some time to mull it over).

Since the military idea was out of the picture, I decided to quit my job and move to San Francisco.
