I attended the Annual Southeast Asian Water festival with the mom. It has been a while since I've gone to the festival and I figured that I might as well go since it might be my last. Also, I was trying to do everything in my power to delay telling my parents about my move to San Francisco.

Long story short: I told my parents. Mission impossible was actually possible...
