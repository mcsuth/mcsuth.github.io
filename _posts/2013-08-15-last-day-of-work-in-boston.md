Today is officially my last day at BII. I'm ready for something new. I have no idea what San Francisco holds for me, but all I know is that relocating from Boston to San Francisco with no concrete plan and a few quarters in my pocket is a huge risk that I will be undertaking. I understand the risks, but you know what they say: Big Risk = Big Reward... or was it Big Loss...?
