<div>
<p>Hi Y’all,</p>
<p>I just registered a domain in pursuit of starting my portfolio. When I registered the domain and began writing my website, I began to get nervous about my time constraints. Right now I’m following an individual who is creating a JavaScript website every day. It’s crazy and fantastic. However, how does she find the time to do it?</p>
<p>I can’t wait for the last day of my job because I will be able to devote time to study before I leave to San Fran at the end of August.</p>
<p>Stay tuned y’all. Things are going to happen.</p>
</div>
