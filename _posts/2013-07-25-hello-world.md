Hi Y’all,

I just registered a domain in pursuit of starting my portfolio. When I registered the domain and began writing my website, I began to get nervous about my time constraints. Right now I’m following an individual who is creating a JavaScript website every day. It’s crazy and fantastic. However, how does she find the time to do it?

I can’t wait for the last day of my job because I will be able to devote time to study before I leave to San Fran at the end of August.

Stay tuned y’all. Things are going to happen.
