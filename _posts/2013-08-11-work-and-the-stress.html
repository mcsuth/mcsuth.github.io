<p>I’m excited to be finishing up with my job this week as I will have free time to devote to studying before I move myself across the country. As of right now, I find it extremely difficult to allocate some time to devote to my personal project because of everyday life. My only free time is the weekend, but I always end up getting some sort of distraction. I.E. My mother likes to visit me and sleep for hours at my place… If there aren’t distractions, I end up getting allergies of some sort or something! I.E. I’ve got allergies right now!</p>
<p>Ah yes, allergies. Yesterday I devoted the day to cleaning and pre-packing my life away. I guess I stirred up all the dust in my room and now I’ve got the runny nose and congestion like non other.</p>
<p>Other stressors in my life: How to break the news to the family that I’m moving and how to see all of my close friends before I move.</p>
<p>So much to do, but so little time! I guess I like to operate like this. If things don’t get done with a bang, then things won’t get done.</p>
<p>Peace, foolios!</p>
