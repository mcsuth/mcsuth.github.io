<p>It’s been a while since I’ve looked at my Ruby on Rails apps and wow, I hardly remember a thing. Thinking back at how it all began is rather funny. Till this day I’d have to say that I still don’t know what I’m doing, but I’m more comfortable with that. </p>

<p>I’ve been working for less than a year as a developer after three months of informal training and dicking around with the console and I’m slowly coming to terms that I’m never going to know everything. Everyday somebody is going to create a new framework or library and things so out of style. </p>

<p>That being said, I’ve been thinking about redoing my Ruby on Rails in Angular. </p>

<p>As much as I enjoy Angular, I’m still having pains from it.</p>

<p>What a whirlwind of week 9 and 10. Week 9 was mostly about JavaScript and Backbone.js. I ended up focusing on JavaScript because I enjoy front-end work and wished to practice making Ajax requests and making one-page apps. Two end products included a web app that allow users to look up movies and save favorite movies and a simple to-do app.</p>

<p>http://moviepop.herokuapp.com/ and simple-list.herokuapp.com</p>

<p>[gallery type=”square” ids=”418,419”]</p>

<p>The simple apps are both one-page apps, sans the log-in page, which was tricky to make into a one page thing. On a weekend I’d like to pimp these apps out with more functionality, but right now I want to focus on really understanding and internalizing the languages.</p>

<p>Week 1o was cut short due to Thanksgiving. I create a simple one-page app that allowed users to keep track of tech jobs - if they have to followup, have a phone interview, or if they have an in-person interview. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get to deploy it on Heroku because I can’t have more than 5 apps on my free account and I didn’t want to delete anything just yet.</p>

<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

      <p class="">
<p>This week was devoted to project number 2, and this time it was a group effort. We started thinking about our project last week on Friday. However, all of out ideas were conflicting. Somebody wanted to create a task management application, another wanted to create a viral blog-type application, and I wanted to make something that geared towards eliminating homelessness. Unfortunately, my idea wasn’t constructed well enough to win the hearts of my teammates, so we ended up settling on a Facebook analysis/visual representation project.</p>

<h3 id="chartifyme">Chartify.Me</h3>

<p>The name of our project was “chartify.me”. The imagined flow of our application was to 1) have an individual to go to our website, 2) sign in with Facebook, 3) see Facebook information via charts.js, and 4) compare with friends’ information.</p>

<p>My contributions to the project were a bit of the front-end, the logic and presentation of the graphs. The most difficult thing about this project was coordinating/allocating who does what.</p>

<p>On the side note, Gus Fring from Breaking Bad sure liked our web app!!!</p>

As of right now, I find it extremely difficult to allocate some time to devote to my personal project because of everyday life. My only free time is the weekend, but I always end up getting some sort of distraction. I.E. My mother likes to visit me and sleep for hours at my place… If there aren’t distractions, I end up getting allergies of some sort or something! I.E. I’ve got allergies right now!</p>\n\n<p>Ah yes, allergies. Yesterday I devoted the day to cleaning and pre-packing my life away. I guess I stirred up all the dust in my room and now I’ve got the runny nose and congestion like non other.</p>\n\n<p>Other stressors in my life: How to break the news to the family that I’m moving and how to see all of my close friends before I move.</p>\n\n<p>So much to do, but so little time! I guess I like to operate like this. If things don’t get done with a bang, then things won’t get done.</p>\n\n<p>Peace, foolios!</p>\n\n"}
