			<p>Hola! My name is Seimith (sā · miTH). I'm a junior full-stack web developer/vector designer looking for an internship or entry-level engineering position.</p>
			<p>I bring great diversity to the white board because of my analytical background in financial mathematics and creative background in freelance vector design.</p>

			<p>One of the first things I did when I got my first computer in 2000 was get an account at Neopets.com and learn HTML and CSS. Over the course of a few years I lost sight of my passion and began to follow the prospects of big money and majored in Financial Mathematics in college. I held a plethora of Finance and Accounting internships while working full-time during those four years of hell. When I finally graduated I realized that I made an unsatisfying choice and wanted to pursue a career that would give me intrinsic happiness. I wanted to do something that was mentally stimulating and something that was magical. I snagged up a job right after college, saved a few quarters and lint in my pocket, and moved from Boston to San Francisco in September '13 to pursue Web Development.</p>
